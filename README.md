## Easy Installation

To install the color themes, just use the extensions tab within VS Code and search for 'Koazie'.

Once installed, themes can be switched using the menu item `Code -> Preferences -> Color Theme`.

## Manual Installation

Clone the repository into `~/.vscode/extensions` and restart the editor.

If you like my themes, please consider rating ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ for the themes. 😄

If you'd like to report a bug with one of the color schemes, please raise an issue on the repository rather than submitting a pull request. This is because the themes run through a generation process, and editing the themes directly is not advised!

Have a blessed day! 😋
